# Training Visualizer

### About
Training Visualizer is a tool created to keep track of my runs & rides. 

The project uses the Strava API to pull & store data to be displayed. For each run/ride, the application plots GPS data on an interactive map
and provides details about the run.

### Other Features
The app allows for filtering between runs/rides, & provides details about my weekly training volume from week to week.

### Technologies
Built with Vue.js & Node.js deployed on AWS with a serverless microservices architecture.
